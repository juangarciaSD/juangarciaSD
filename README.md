### Hi there, welcome to my GitHub profile 👋

The name's Juan, I'm 17 years old, currently living in Tennessee, US.

I'm a self-taught Software Engineer!

I'm a Part-Time Software Engineer working at [Zyndicate Labs](https://www.zyndicate.app)! I'm also a Part-Time Full-Stack Developer working on a project that will allow teachers, students, and parents stay connected with each other. The current project soon to be an app doesn't have a name at the moment. 

You should follow me on Twitter as I'm mostly active there
